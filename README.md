# Local Lenz
## Mission
Local Lenz seeks to provide users with a reimagined art viewing gallery experience they can enjoy despite the pandemic. Utilizing technologies such as Unity and Flask, we seek to provide an experience that is engaging and personalized.
## Parts
### Unity Environment
This section has a user walk through a series of environments in which their preferences for location, art style, and medium are recorded so that the most relevant art can be presented in their gallery. Start in the location scene, and move through the game to the end.
### Web App
This section compiles art from some relevant artists and allows users to move through and experience it at their own pace. The code for this section is exclusively contained within the "web" folder.
